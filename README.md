# Workflow_ICE
First workflow exercise for team ICE.

## What we did
1. First step was to create a github repo with the base structure.
2. Every team-member did a git pull.
3. Then every team-member created their own branch to work on.
4. When we were done we did a git pull from main branch to add it to our local branch, to deal with all merge conflicts.
5. After the conflict we did a git push to our branch then switched to the main branch to do a pull.
